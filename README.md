#  Stateful navigation using The Composable Architecture 

This little example code demosntrates how to establish stateful navigation. It might be helpful for others in the future, so I've put it here. I may get around to adding a second list in the middle view, otherwise I leave that as an exercise for the reader - will gladly take a pull request if somebody else wants to..
